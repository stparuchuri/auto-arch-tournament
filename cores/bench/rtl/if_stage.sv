// rtl/if_stage.sv
//
// Instruction fetch stage. Holds the PC register; the IF/ID payload
// (pc + instr + valid) is *combinational* — there is no separate IF/ID
// flop in this microarchitecture, the next-stage's ID/EX register
// captures everything one cycle later.
//
// On flush or redirect, the instruction emitted to ID is forced to NOP
// (`0x00000013` = ADDI x0,x0,0). This prevents the hazard unit from
// observing a real rs1/rs2 from a wrong-path instruction and inserting
// a spurious load-use stall the cycle after a taken branch.
//
// Latency:        PC-reg update is synchronous; output is combinational.
// RVFI fields:    feeds pc_rdata (via ID/EX/MEM/WB) and pc_wdata (via
//                 EX-stage redirect).
