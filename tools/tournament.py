#   stages rtl/*.sv into formal/riscv-formal/cores/auto-arch-researcher/,
#   which lives in the MAIN repo (the worktree's formal/riscv-formal is a
#   symlink). Two slots running formal concurrently would corrupt that
#   shared staging area. NEVER loosen this gate above 1.

# - fpga=1 is a CPU saturation gate. Each slot's run_fpga_eval already
#   forks 3 parallel nextpnr seeds; N slots × 3 seeds at once would thrash
#   on most hardware. Loosening it is a perf trade-off, not a correctness
#   risk.

# Phase 3 (lint/synth/build) and Phase 5 (cosim) are not gated: each
