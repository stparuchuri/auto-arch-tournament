"""Runs the real riscv-formal suite via formal/run_all.sh.

The real suite is generated at runtime by formal/run_all.sh (which invokes
genchecks.py against our rtl/*.sv + wrapper.sv + checks.cfg) and runs the
~45 I-base / M-ext insn checks plus reg / pc_fwd / pc_bwd / causal /
unique / cover / ill / liveness — 53 total against the V0 baseline.

If genchecks.py crashes mid-run and only emits one .sby task that
vacuously passes, the old `passed > 0 and failed == 0` rule would
return success. EXPECTED_MIN_CHECKS prevents that.
