Your job: implement the following architectural hypothesis in SystemVerilog.

{target_banner}{philosophy}## Hypothesis

Category: {hypothesis['category']}

Motivation:
{hypothesis['motivation']}

Proposed change:
{hypothesis['hypothesis']}

Advisory file changes (you may deviate, add, rename, or restructure freely):

## Architecture
{arch}

## Hard invariants and don't-touch list
{claude_md}

## Current SystemVerilog Source (your working directory)
{src_dump}

## Instructions
1. Implement the hypothesis by editing, creating, or restructuring files in {rtl_rel}/.
   You may create new files, delete files, merge files, or split files.
2. The top module MUST stay named `core` and expose the io_* RVFI port set.
   Do NOT modify anything in tools/, schemas/, formal/, fpga/, test/cosim/,
   bench/, ARCHITECTURE.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md, setup.sh, or Makefile.

   Do NOT write helper scripts at the workspace root or anywhere outside
   cores/{target}/. Files like `patch.py`, `patch_core.py`, `update_files.py`,
   or `apply.sh` are ALWAYS off-limits — even if they only edit allowed
   paths, the orchestrator's sandbox will flag them as `sandbox_violation`
   and discard your entire iteration. If your change spans many files,
   sequence multiple `edit` tool calls. Do not try to `cat <<EOF >` or
   `python3 patch.py` your way around the edit tool — `bash` redirects
   land in the wrong working directory anyway, so even if the sandbox
   permitted them they would write to the wrong tree.
3. After implementing, verify the build:
     verilator --lint-only -Wall -Wno-MULTITOP -sv +incdir+{rtl_rel} {rtl_rel}/*.sv
   Fix any errors / warnings before finishing.
4. Self-check formal locally before declaring done:
     bash formal/run_all.sh
   This is the same gate the orchestrator runs in Phase 4. Catching
   easy mistakes here (broken decoder arm, missed forwarding case,
   missing default in a case statement) saves an entire iteration
   getting marked broken on a one-line fix.

   The MOST COMMON formal failure is breaking the RVFI channel-0
   retirement contract: `io_rvfi_valid_0` must stay driven by the
   actual retirement signal (typically `mem_wb_w.valid`), and every
   channel-0 field must mirror the retiring instruction. If your
   change touches the writeback or commit path, re-read CLAUDE.md
   invariant #1 before declaring done — symptoms of breaking it are
   `formal_failed: no_checks_generated` or `*_ch0` PREUNSAT in the
   sby logs.

   On failure, run_all.sh prints the failing check's logfile.txt tail
   to stdout — last 30 lines, which contains the SMT counterexample
   from sby. Read it, identify the bug class, fix {rtl_rel}/, re-run.

   CAP: 2 fix attempts. If formal still fails after 2 retries, STOP.
   Document what you tried and what's still broken in
   implementation_notes.md and exit. Do not fight a stubborn check —
   some hypotheses are genuinely wrong and the orchestrator's hard
   gate is the right place to record that, not your watchdog budget.

   A passing local formal does NOT mean the hypothesis is accepted.
   The orchestrator still runs cosim (RVFI byte-exact vs Python ISS)
   and FPGA fitness (3-seed nextpnr median Fmax × CoreMark IPC) after
   you finish; passing formal locally just means you didn't ship an
   obvious bug.
5. Write implementation_notes.md in the current directory describing:
   - What you actually changed (vs. the hypothesis plan)
   - Any deviations and why
   - Any concerns about the implementation
   - Local formal status (pass / fail-after-N-attempts) and, if it
     failed, what counterexample you saw and what you tried.

Edit, create, or delete files in the worktree as needed. The eval gates
will check the result; do not output any other narrative."""

    Invokes the active agent runtime in the worktree to implement the hypothesis.

    Streams agent output to <worktree>/.agent.log so phase 2 progress
    is observable via `tail -f` from another terminal. The default
    `claude -p` (text mode) buffers everything until the final response,
    which makes a 5-15 minute architectural-change agent look frozen.
    --output-format stream-json emits NDJSON tool-use events as they
    happen, so each Edit/Write/Bash lands in the log within ~1 second
    of the model dispatching it. Codex streams its output similarly.

    A best-effort one-liner per tool_use is also echoed to the
    orchestrator's terminal — if the provider changes the event shape,
    that echo silently degrades but the raw log in .agent.log stays
    authoritative.

    Args:
      hypothesis_path — path to the hypothesis YAML to implement.
      worktree        — absolute path to the implementation worktree.
