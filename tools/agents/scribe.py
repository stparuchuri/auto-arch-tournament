A CPU microarchitecture experiment just finished on cores/{target}/. Your job
is to append AT MOST ONE bullet to cores/{target}/LESSONS.md summarizing what
was learned, OR write nothing at all if no useful lesson can be distilled.

## This iteration

- id:        {entry.get('id', 'unknown')}
- title:     {entry.get('title', 'unknown')}
- category:  {entry.get('category', 'unknown')}
- outcome:   {entry.get('outcome', 'unknown')}
- fitness:   {fitness_str}
- delta_pct: {delta_str}
- error:     {entry.get('error') or 'none'}

Motivation:
{hyp.get('motivation', '(none)')}

Hypothesis:
{hyp.get('hypothesis', '(none)')}

Expected impact:
{hyp.get('expected_impact', '(none)')}

Implementation notes (the implementing agent's self-report):
{notes}

RTL diff (cores/{target}/rtl/) — what was actually changed:
```
{diff_block}
```

## Your job

Append at most ONE bullet to cores/{target}/LESSONS.md, in this format:

  - YYYY-MM-DD <id> (<outcome>, <delta_pct>): <one-sentence lesson>

A useful lesson:
  - Captures *why* the outcome happened, not just *what* happened.
  - Generalizes to future iterations (a pattern, gotcha, or design constraint),
    not a one-off bug.
  - Names specific RTL constructs / hazards / CoreMark behaviors when relevant.

Examples of GOOD lessons (do not copy verbatim — write your own):
  - "Dual-issue without a 2W register file creates WAW hazards riscv-formal's
    'reg' check catches; reg file must expose two write ports."
  - "64-entry BHT regressed CoreMark; the always-not-taken default was already
    well-tuned to this benchmark's branch profile."
  - "Adding a fetch buffer gained Fmax (+12 MHz) but blew the LUT budget by
    30% on Tang Nano 20K — fetch-side area is the binding constraint."

SKIP (write nothing — do not modify any file) if:
  - The cause of the outcome is unclear from the available info.
  - The bug was a trivial typo / missing default arm with no general lesson.
  - This iteration plainly duplicates an already-recorded lesson.

If cores/{target}/LESSONS.md does not exist, create it with the single bullet.
If it exists, APPEND to its end (preserve all prior content).

Do NOT modify ANY other file. Do NOT print the bullet — write it to the file.
Do NOT add headers, sections, prose, or anything other than the bullet line.
