## How to dig deeper
- Full per-iteration history is at: cores/{target}/experiments/log.jsonl
  Each line is one experiment: hypothesis prose + fitness numbers + outcome
  + the implementing agent's implementation_notes. Use Read or Grep to dig
  into specific past hypotheses by id, category, outcome, or content.
- LESSONS.md (above) is the curated, append-only log of one-line takeaways.
  Read it before proposing — it captures negative knowledge (what failed
  and why) you would otherwise re-discover.

## Instructions
1. Read LESSONS.md and the recent outcomes above. Grep log.jsonl for
   relevant prior attempts in the same category before proposing.
2. Identify the most promising architectural improvement.
3. Use the **write** tool to write a hypothesis YAML file at:
     cores/{target}/experiments/hypotheses/<id>.yaml
   Do NOT output the YAML as text in your reply — the orchestrator only
   sees files written via the write tool.

{id_clause}

## Required YAML structure (validates against schemas/hypothesis.schema.json)

```yaml
id: hyp-YYYYMMDD-NNN-rRsS         # exactly the ID above
title: "Short description ≥5 chars"
category: micro_opt                # one of: micro_opt | structural | extension | predictor | memory
motivation: |
  Why this matters — a few sentences. Minimum 20 chars.
hypothesis: |
  What you propose to change and why it should help. Minimum 20 chars.
expected_impact:
  fitness_delta_pct: 5             # INTEGER (-50..+50). Schema rejects strings.
  confidence: medium                # exactly one of: low | medium | high. Schema rejects anything else.
changes:                            # at least one entry
  - file: rtl/forward_unit.sv      # IMPORTANT: relative to rtl/, no `cores/<target>/` prefix.
    description: "What you'll change in this file."
  - file: rtl/id_stage.sv          # Or `test/test_<name>.py` for cocotb suites.
    description: "..."
```

### Common mistakes that make schemas reject the file (do NOT do these)

- `expected_impact: "free-text description"` — schema requires an OBJECT with `fitness_delta_pct` (integer) and `confidence` (enum). Strings are rejected.
- `expected_impact: {{fitness_delta_pct: 5.0, confidence: "Med"}}` — `fitness_delta_pct` must be a Python integer (not float, not "5"); `confidence` must be lowercase `low`/`medium`/`high`.
- `changes[i].file: cores/{target}/rtl/alu.sv` — schema's regex requires the `rtl/...` form. Drop the `cores/<target>/` prefix.
- `changes[i].file: alu.sv` — the regex requires the `rtl/` prefix.
- Writing the YAML inline in your message instead of using the write tool.

Use the write tool now."""
