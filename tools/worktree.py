"""Git worktree lifecycle management.

Worktrees are forked off the loop's *active* branch (default: main) and
merged back into that same branch on accept. The active branch is set
by the orchestrator at run start; functions here take it as a parameter
so the same module supports both the default `main` flow and sandbox
research branches without state.
