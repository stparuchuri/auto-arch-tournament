"""Bench matrix runner.

Drives the LLM benchmark: enumerates (model, rep) jobs from
tools/bench/models.yaml, clones the configured ref (default: main)
into an isolated per-job directory, drives tools.orchestrator
with the model's runtime AGENT_PROVIDER (codex / opencode / claude),
then summarizes the result and appends a row to bench/results.jsonl.

The default ref was previously `bench-fixture-v1` (the orphan fixture
branch); after the nret-adapter + reliability work merged to main,
main is the canonical source and the orphan is no longer needed.
Override with --ref for reproducing a specific historical snapshot.

Resumable: re-running skips (model, rep) pairs already in results.jsonl.

Usage:
    python -m tools.bench.runner                                  # full matrix
    python -m tools.bench.runner --reps 1 --only opus-47          # subset
    python -m tools.bench.runner --parallel 3 --max-cost 50       # 3 in parallel
    python -m tools.bench.runner --dry-run                        # plan only

    # Why a copy instead of a symlink: the bench rep is a *standalone*
    # `git clone`, not a `git worktree add`. Codex's
    # `--sandbox workspace-write` resolves the workspace root to this
    # rep clone, and a symlink whose target lives outside that root
    # (the parent repo's vendored riscv-formal) is read-only from the
    # agent's perspective. The orchestrator log on a recent broken
    # bench slot makes this explicit:
    #     "The repository's formal/riscv-formal/cores/bench staging
    #      area is read-only in this sandbox, so the direct formal
    #      script can't write..."
    # The agent then burns dozens of shell calls building a /tmp
    # mirror as workaround instead of fixing the RTL, and the
    # orchestrator's hard formal gate is the first thing to see the
    # bug. A real in-clone copy keeps riscv-formal inside the
    # sandboxed root so `bash formal/run_all.sh` works in-loop.
    # Opencode's permission system has the same workspace-root
    # property, so the fix benefits both workflow-trained runtimes.

    # tools/worktree.py's per-iteration sub-worktree symlink uses

    Opencode emits a `step_finish` event after each turn carrying the
    cumulative `tokens` and `cost` for that step:
      {"type":"step_finish", ..., "part":{"tokens":{"input":N,"output":N,
        "reasoning":N,"cache":{"read":N,"write":N}}, "cost":F, ...}}

    `tokens.input` is the *uncached* portion of the prompt; cache hits
    are reported separately under `tokens.cache.read`. To stay
    consistent with parse_codex_cost_from_log (which sums codex's gross
    `input_tokens` per turn — cache included), we count opencode's
    gross input as `tokens.input + tokens.cache.read + tokens.cache.write`.
    Without this normalization an apples-to-apples comparison with
    codex showed a 15× gap that was almost entirely cache-accounting,
    not actual model work — codex's xhigh n10 run reported 16.3M
    "input" of which 14M was cached re-reads of the same prompt;
    opencode at xhigh did the equivalent ~10M (1.1M new + 9.1M cache
    reads) but the saved row read as 1.1M because cache.read was
    skipped. Cumulative effect: the bench underreported opencode's
    token usage by ~10×.

    `cost: 0` is normal under OAuth subscriptions (no per-token
    billing); we still tally token counts regardless.

    cache.write is normally 0 under OpenAI; including it costs nothing
    when 0 and keeps the field semantics correct if a model family

    """Walk the rep clone's git history (across all reachable refs +
    reflog) and recover every line ever written to
    cores/<target>/experiments/log.jsonl.

    Why: orchestrator.append_log auto-commits each iteration's entry
    as `log: <id> <outcome>`. The commits are append-only and survive
    HEAD-rewinding bugs (we hit one earlier — the bench-fixture-v1
    tag/branch ambiguity caused mid-run rewinds that orphaned earlier
    rounds, but the commits themselves stayed in the object DB).
    Walking the reflog plus all reachable refs recovers them.

    Strategy:
      1. List every commit reachable from any ref OR the reflog whose
         message starts with `log: hyp-` (per the orchestrator's
         commit-message convention) — use --walk-reflogs and --all.
      2. For each commit, `git show <sha>:cores/<target>/experiments/
         log.jsonl` and take the LAST line — append_log writes one
         entry per commit, so the new line is always at EOF.
      3. Dedup by hypothesis id (different commits might re-write the
         same entry).
      4. Sort by (round_id, slot) so the reconstructed log is in
         logical order even if the underlying commit graph isn't.

    Returns:
      list of JSONL lines (one per iteration) or None if no commits
